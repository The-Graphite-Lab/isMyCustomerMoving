  - copy data into this
- in frontend folder, copy .env information into the .env file
- In both the accounts and data folder, switch the names of migrations and migrations1
- Run docker-compose up
- In another terminal, run docker-compose exec backend python manage.py loaddata data.json
- Switch back the names of the migrations folders and run python manage.py migrate --fake

## Frontend ‚≠ê

*frontend and backend applications must be running at localhost:8000 and localhost:3000 respectively*

Test data must be reloaded between test runs with the following command
